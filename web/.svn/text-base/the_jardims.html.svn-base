      <h1>Field of Dreams ~ The Jardim Family</h1>
      <h2>Danny Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfDannySm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='200' class='singleImgL' />
      Sophia's first born. Has been instrumental in creating many of the cooking and water heating facilities at Field of Dreams. His current projects include the creation and expansion of the <a href='garden.html' title='Our Vegetable Garden' class='txtLink'>vegetable garden</a> and is currently working toward setting up his own company. With a fully trained and experienced background in engineering he plans to bring education and jobs to his local and wider communities. 
      </p>

      <h2>Daniel "Bokkie" Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfBokieSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='191' class='singleImgR' />
      Son number one of Benildy, Sophias first Grand child and just too damn talented to be fair. Speaks three languages fluently, can drive pretty much anything that has a starter motor and that's just scratching the surface. He is currently the only white child at his school which I think reflects just how far out in the wilds Field of Dreams is situated.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Jean-Louis Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfJeanLouisSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='218' class='singleImgL' />
      Sophia's third child, married to Chantell, with their Son - Raphael. Lives in one of the outlying cabins running his business of jewellery and arts / crafts. Our resident beekeeper who runs the Bee Apprenticeship Programme for the children. Has considerable knowledge of the local fauna and flora and can often be found sporting a snake or some other critter in an attempt to relocate it to a more suitable location. Benjamin is his first child and visits on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Chantell Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfChantellSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='194' class='singleImgR' />
      Maker of Grade One soups (yum), wife of Jean-Louis and Mother to Raphael. Works in Nelspruit and can usually be found chasing her son from location to location around the farm when she is back home. Has a heart of gold, feeds you when hungry and will even offer to do your laundry... aww, bless. She is almost certainly Jean-Louis's better half, but he'll deny that...
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Casandra &amp; Raphael Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfCasandraRaphaelSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='137' class='singleImgL' />
      Field of Dreams 'Cheeky Monkeys'. Casandra is Benildy's youngest whilst Raphael is Jean-Louis and Chantell's first born. Trouble from birth they will keep you entertained if not busy. That perpetual piercing scream that you hear will generally be one of them 'not getting what they want'. Jokes aside, they are lovely and can be angels... at least ten minutes a day anyway.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Benildy Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfBenildySm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='202' class='singleImgR' />
      Sophia's second born, Mother to "Bokkie", Donavan &amp; Casandra. Has a bit of a thing for animals, that's putting it mildly, domestic &amp; livestock outnumber humans by possiibly ten to one, the actual figures are probably higher. Yes, that's a monkey (Marmoset) on her shoulder... "enough said" we think, and just like her Mother, is a talented seamstress. She can also use a computer in many more creative ways than you would believe possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Donavan Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfDonavanSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='195' class='singleImgL' />
      Benildy's second born, often misunderstood or at least greatly underrated, this fellah can eat anyone we know under the table. Like his Brother has great talents building with his hands and will one day shock everyone when he achieves something incredible. In the meantime, keep an eye on your plate of food... you have been warned.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Kyle, Benjamin and K&eacute;gan Jardim</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/gallery/sm/jfKeeganBenjaminKarlSm.jpg' alt='img' width='180' height='142' class='singleImgR' />
      'The three Amigos'. Kyle and K&eacute;gan are Danny's first born with Benjamin being Jean-Louis's first. Whilst none actually live on the farm they are regular faces around the stoep. Watch out for fishing tackle, pellet guns and video games when this lot are around...
