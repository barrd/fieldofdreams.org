      <h2>The Start: Making a difference in one small child's life.</h2>

      In January 1996, Sophia Jardim was searching for a way to put something back into her community. She lived the life of a proper Afrikaans householder- raising her three children, working in a small South African town and doing charity work within her local community.
      </p><p>
      Sophia decided to inquire at her nearby hospital to see if any help was needed with those children whose parents were either sick or busy working. At the time, Sophia had no idea that so many sick, abused or simply homeless children had in fact been left in the hospital indefinitely, abandoned through mistreatment or death. A social worker told Sophia about one particular little boy who was staying at Barberton Hospital, whose parents had died from Aids. He had been born on 5th December, 1994 and had been brought to the hospital at the age of three months. He was now thirteen months old. His name was Nkosingiphile: <i>"Gift from God"</i>.
      </p>
      <h2>Say hello to Phile - "The Gift from God".</h2>
      <p>

      On 5th  April, 1996, Sophia decided that if she could, she would take this child away From the hospital and take him into her own home. She had been visiting Nkosingiphile (Phile) for four months now and it was on this day, 5th April 1995, that for the first time Phile had cried when Sophia had left him after a visit. Sophia got permission to take Phile into her home, and she did it with a heavy but happy heart. For she had known the pain of not belonging; Sophia had also lost her mother as a baby.
      </p><p>
      Having been told by the doctors that Phile was only expected to live for another six months, Sophia knew that she had to give this child all that she could. From this day onwards, Phile finally knew what it was to have a home and to be truly loved. Love and devotion was shown to this small child by Sophia and her family and somehow this seemed to make Phile want to live again, for he now laughed and smiled and began to take in the world around him. Furthermore, little did Phile know that he was such an inspiration to the Jardim family that their doors would now be open for many more children to come. Phile did defy the doctor's expectations of only six months to live and he eventually passed away from Aids two years later on 6th April 1997. Sophia Jardim and her home were now an official "Safe Haven" and foster care home.
