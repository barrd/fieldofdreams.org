      <h2>Life after Phile: Field of Dreams continues with his legacy...</h2>

      Since Phile, forty-six orphaned and abandoned children have been in the care of Sophia and her family. The Jardim family has seen sixteen of these children replaced with their own families when deemed safe. They have also seen nine of these children pass away by the hand of Aids. 
      </p><p>
      Presently, Sophia and her "family", in what is known as 'Esperado Childrens Haven' are located on a farm in the Low's Creek area. This farm currently houses twenty children on a permanent basis. The farm was bought for Sophia Jardim, she made the children the main beneficiaries of Esperado Childrens Haven Trust on the 1st  October 2001. However, it has not been an entirely easy ride for this now big family-the main building on the farm was completely destroyed by a fire on 7th  November, 2002. Fortunately, nobody was hurt and thanks to the true kindness of SASOL, a new was built in its place. After months of living in outbuildings and tents, the family moved into their new house on 6th  May, 2004. 
      </p>
      <h2>Field of Dreams: Evolution rather than Revolution.</h2>
      <p>

      Moreover, Esperado Childrens Haven has evolved – it does far more now then to just provide a home for orphaned and abandoned children. Sophia and her family also try to do what they can for the local community, because they can see the suffering that goes on here due to poverty and the terrible losses that have inevitably come with the HIV / Aids epidemic.
      </p><p>
      Furthermore, the Jardim family has set up links with international organizations such as Peace Corps and Tenteleni, that send people to the farm and to the community in order to promote HIV / Aids awareness and sustainable development. With any surplus food, clothing or blankets the haven also helps a number of underprivileged families within the local area.
      </p><p>
      Finally, Esperado Childrens Haven has recently set up links with orphanages and care centers in the surrounding Mpumalanga province. This new project involves the children from these orphanages and care centers coming to Esperado Childrens Haven in their school holidays for a change of environment and to experience life on a farm, far away from the busy cities in which they live (Field of Dreams).
      </p>
      <h2>Dependancies &amp; the Volunteers... The Future.</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconFing5.png' alt='img' width='60' height='60' class='singleImgL noPrint' />
      Nevertheless, the family exists on very little help from the Government, as legislation has it that foster grants are only available for up to six foster children within one home. Maintenance for the rest of the children thus depends entirely upon help and kind donations from volunteers and private donors. Despite these financial difficulties however, Sophia and her ever-expanding family remain confident and optimistic. The haven’s motto is such that one person really can make a difference, and they see no reason for this not to continue being the truth that it has been right from the very start with Phile.
