      <h2>Sophiaâ€™s Thoughts and Vision (in her own words).</h2>
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      What seems impossible in life is possible in my dreams. Thought is the birth of our miracles. If a fish swims with the current it dies.
      </p>

      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      We all know the law of the universe is LOVE, if you build anything on that foundation you obey the law of one. WE are ONE.
      </p>
      <hr class='spacer' />
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      The law of the world is also based on LOVE but people have forgotten. We must remind them that we are all one. We just need to ask.
      </p>
      <hr class='spacer' />
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      If we create the space for the children to be healed they will come, the universe will send them.
      </p>

      <p>

      Create the miracles in your thoughts so that they can become a reality.
      </p>

      The field is here on the farm, now we need the souls to gather together to build the "Field of Dreams". The gates are now open and I ask the Universe to help me to let it all happen.
      </p>
      <hr class='spacer' />
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      If you find it in your heart that you belong, this is the call to say the gates are now open.
      </p>
      <hr class='spacer' />
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      We must have workshops to help them to cope with the challenges of the world.
      </p>
      <hr class='spacer' />
      <p>
      <img src='imgs/shared/iconEyeSm.png' alt='img' width='22' height='12' class='smImgL' />
      We must help them see there is another way of life without hurt or rejection. To cope with stress, to love unconditionally. To love nature in all forms.
